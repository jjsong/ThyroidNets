### Thyroid Nodue Analysis Using Pretrained Neural Networks

> Fine Needle Aspiration (FNA) is the procedure of choice for evaluation thyroid nodules and FNA may be required even for nodules with very low suspicion of malignancy if they are larger than 2 cm. However, avoiding unnecessary FNA is important in order to reduce complications related to FNA and to reduce medical expenses. In this study, we developed an image analysis model using deep learning technique, and evaluated if the model could predict which nodules would have benign FNA results.
